# Possible Improvements
1. Add real-time API for FX Rate.
2. Add error handling for cases where the API call for the real-time fx rate fails or returns invalid data.
3. Implement a feature to allow the user to export the historical data table to a file.
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions, such as switching between input fields and activating the override mode.
5. Add tooltips or help text to explain the functionality of each feature and input field.
6. Add a tooltip or pop-up message to explain why the override mode has been deactivated due to a 2% difference in the fx rate.
7. Implement a feature to allow the user to choose the precision of the fx rate input, so they can enter rates with more or fewer decimal places.
8. Implement a feature to allow the user to set a limit on the maximum or minimum amount that can be entered, to prevent input errors or fraudulent activity.
9. Add a feature to allow the user to specify a different time interval for the polling of the fx rate.
10. Add date to historical data.
11. Tests scenarios should be written.
